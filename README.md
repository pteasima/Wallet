# Wallet
repo for testing IncrementalUI a Elm architecture in Swift

## Why Wallet?
For lack of a better idea, Im gonna implement a "bitcoin wallet", or at least the UI. I wanna get inspired by Bread wallet for iOS. Subject to change. Especially subject to me leaving this unfinished as all of my other side projects.

For now, its a screen that changes colors. + timetravel

## Timetravel
Long press to open timetraveling debugger, long press again to see a collection of past states. This is implemented using Incremental and Elm architecture as well. I have fancy stuff in the pipeline, for now its really simple and looks like shit.
