/// Base Protocol for static and instance access to `Context`.
/// The Base Protocol is used to pin the `Context` for the
/// 2 protocols that will be used in your Code.
/// - HasInstanceContext
/// - HasStaticContext
/// They are provided in order use a Resolver in a static fashion
/// or as an instance property.
public protocol HasContext {
   associatedtype Context
   associatedtype Source = Self
}

/// Every type that should get access to dependencies on an instance level
/// should conform to `HasInstanceContext`.
/// In order to confirm the Type needs a propery called `resolver`.
/// For structs it works out-of-the-box.
/// For classes make sure to use the final keyword.
/// The actual `resolver` should not be used as it only treated as a flag in order to
/// resolve access from the Context.
///
/// Typical Usage:
///
///     final class ViewController: UIViewController, ContextAware {
///       var resolver = `default`
///     }
///
public protocol HasInstanceContext: HasContext {
  var resolve: Resolver<Self, Context> { get set }

/// should conform to `HasStaticContext`.
/// In order to confirm the Type needs a propery called `resolver`.
/// The actual `resolver` should not be used as it only treated as a flag in order to
/// resolve access from the Context.

/// Typical Usage:
///
///     struct StaticThing: ContextAware {
///       static var resolver = `default`
///     }
